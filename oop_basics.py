#creating an object

#create class chicken
class chicken:
    #features
    feature_1 = "feathers"

    feature_4 = "beak"

    #chicken activities
    act1 = "lay eggs"
    act2 = "crow"
    act3 = "sleep"

    #create a chicken object
chick = chicken()
print(chick.act1)


#class car

    part3 = "hood"
    part4 = "bumper"

    #car models

    #object creation
